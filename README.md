# Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds - A Survey

###  Introduction
Point cloud is point sets defined in 3D metric space. Point cloud has become one of the most significant data format for 3D representation. Its gaining increased popularity as a result of increased availability of acquisition devices, such as LiDAR, as well as increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality I have studied the Survey paper in detail and published a short story of my understanding.

### Learnings
1. The Survey  presented a contemporary survey of the state-of-the-art methods for 3D understanding, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection & tracking, and 3D scene and object segmentation. 
2. A comprehensive taxonomy and performance comparison of these methods  was presented. 
3. Merits and demerits of various methods were also covered, with potential research directions being listed.
